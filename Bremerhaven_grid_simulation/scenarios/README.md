# Scenarios
- Already created scenario YAMLs can be found in all folders ending with **_percentages**.
- Scenarios can be created using the **scenario_creator_helper** and the values stored in the **raw_<component>_values**.
- Scenarios can also be combined if the there is need to scale something up and something else down at the same time. For that,
just use the **scenario_combiner**.
- Finally, when evaluating experiments, the **winzent_log_analysis** will automatically create data out of the the log files created by
the experiments.
