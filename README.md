# Winzent_ethics repository
This is the corresponding repository to the master's thesis: 

**Moral values in WINZENT - The development of an ethical decision-making process for a
decentralized agent system in a power grid environment**

The repo is split into two parts:
1. The folders containing the files and the instructions to replicate the simulations done with the Bremerhaven grid. Furthermore, this is where the gathered data and the tools to create grid scenarios are stored.
2. The implementation of the Winzent ethics module and reformatted Winzent base agent paired with test scenarios that can be run immediately.
